# cFAT-GAN


This package contains the code to create and train the Conditional Feature Augmented and Transformed GAN as described in the paper, *cFAT-GAN: Conditional Simulation of Electron-Proton Scattering Events with Variate Beam Energies by a Feature Augmented and Transformed Generative Adversarial Network*. Training data provided consists of 5 datasets of Pythia-generated scattering events at beam energies of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 GeV. This package is written in python (`python3`) and uses the packages `Tensorflow` and `Keras` for the implementation.
